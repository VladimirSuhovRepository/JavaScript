There are 6 main methods to search for nodes in DOM:

Method	Searches by...	Can call on an element?	Live?
getElementById	id	-	-
getElementsByName	name	-	✔
getElementsByTagName	tag or '*'	✔	✔
getElementsByClassName	class	✔	✔
querySelector	CSS-selector	✔	-
querySelectorAll	CSS-selector	✔	-
Please note that methods getElementById and getElementsByName can only be called in the context of the document: document.getElementById(...). But not on an element: elem.getElementById(...) would cause an error.

Other methods can be called on elements too. For instance elem.querySelectorAll(...) will search inside elem (in the DOM subtree).

Besides that:

There is elem.matches(css) to check if elem matches the given CSS selector.
There is elem.closest(css) to look for the nearest ancestor that matches the given CSS-selector. The elem itself is also checked.
And let’s mention one more method here to check for the child-parent relationship:

elemA.contains(elemB) returns true if elemB is inside elemA (a descendant of elemA) or when elemA==elemB.
